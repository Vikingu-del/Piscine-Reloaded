# Piscine-Reloaded
"Piscine Reloaded" is a curated collection of exercises and projects revisiting fundamental concepts learned during the intensive coding bootcamp. Dive back into the fundamentals, sharpen your skills, and embark on a journey of continuous learning and improvement. ðŸš€

Each exercise was a refresh on what we did to prepare ourself before we were starting the common core at 42 Wolfsburg.
